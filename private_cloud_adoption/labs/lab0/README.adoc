= Private Cloud Adoption - Lab 0

== Spinning Up OpenStack
. Login to https://labs.opentlc.com/
. Select `Services -> Catalogs`
. Expand `OPENTL Cloud Infrastructure`
. Order `Red Hat Tech Exchange OSP10`
. Check your email to obtain unique hostname

== Access to Lab Environment

Your OpenStack lab environment contains the following:

* Workstation external DNS: workstation-$GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com 
* Workstation internal IP: 172.16.7.252
* Controller: 172.16.7.50
* Compute1: 172.16.7.51
* Compute2: 172.16.7.52
* Horizon external URL: http://ctrl01-$GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
* username: admin
* password: <instructor will provide>
* external network: flat
* external subnet: 192.168.56.0/24
* external floating ip pool: 192.168.56.100 - 192.168.56.200

=== Access Lab Workstation

. Use SSH to access the lab workstation using your private SSH key and OPENTLC SSO credentials:
.. For macOS and Linux users, execute the following:
+
[source,text]
----
$ ssh -i /path/to/your/ssh-key your-opentlc-sso-login@workstation-$GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
----
+
[NOTE]
Replace `$GUID` with your lab environment GUID provided in the provisioning email you received when ordering.  Replace `your-opentlc-sso-login` with your OPENTLC SSO user name.

.. For Windows users, consult link:https://www.opentlc.com/ssh.html[this page^] for documentation on using PuTTY.
+
[IMPORTANT]
To avoid problems when using SSH to access your OPENTLC lab hosts, always use the FQDN host name and not the IP or Ravello DNS entry.

. After logging in, make sure you can become `root` on the lab workstation:
+
[source,text]
----
$ sudo -i
#
----

== Pre-lab coniguration
Due to some last minute changes the following changes are needed in your enviroments before we beging the rest of the labs.

=== Enable Flat type for External Network

. Edit `/root/answers.txt`
. On line 840 edit the entry to add `flat` as such:
+
[source,text]
----
CONFIG_NEUTRON_ML2_TYPE_DRIVERS=flat,vxlan
----
+
. Run `PackStack` as such:
+
----
packstack --answer-file=/root/answers.txt
----

=== Configure Horizon Vhost
In order to reach your Horizon host via it's public DNS name, add it as an alias so httpd is aware of it:

. Edit `/etc/httpd/conf.d/15-horizon_vhost.conf`
. Add your controller's public hostname to this file somewhere between lines 31 and 34:
+
[source,text]
----
ServerAlias ctrl01-$GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
----
+
. Restart httpd with `systemctl restart httpd`
